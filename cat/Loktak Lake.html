        <h2>About Loktak Lake</h2>
        <p>
            Loktak Lake, nestled in the northeastern state of Manipur, India, is a natural marvel renowned for its
            unique floating phumdis (masses of vegetation, soil, and organic matter). This picturesque lake spans
            approximately 287 square kilometers, making it the largest freshwater lake in Northeast India. The phumdis
            not only serve as a distinctive ecological habitat but also support a community of fishermen who live on
            these floating islands.
            <br><br>

            At the center of Loktak Lake lies the Keibul Lamjao National Park, which is the world's only floating
            national park. It is a critical habitat for the endangered Manipur brow-antlered deer, also known as the
            Sangai. The serene waters, dotted with colorful boats, reflect the surrounding hills and vibrant vegetation,
            creating a surreal panorama.
            <br><br>

            Loktak Lake is not only an ecological treasure but also holds cultural significance for the Manipuri people.
            The Sendra Island on the lake serves as a popular tourist spot for boat rides and leisurely strolls. The
            lake's sheer expanse and rich biodiversity make it a destination that seamlessly combines natural splendor
            with cultural heritage.
