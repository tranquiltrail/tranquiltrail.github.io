        <h2>About Chuka Beach</h2>
        <p>
            Unlike the many beaches in Goa, this beach isn't for soaking up the sun in your beachwear. While we would
            not mind spending hours by the beachside in Goa, the good thing for those hard-pressed for time and money is
            that there is a beach in the state of Uttar Pradesh still not known to many.
            Luckily, not everyone needs to rush to an exotic destination to have a tropical escape. Chuka Beach, close
            to the Himalayan forests in Uttar Pradesh (UP), has plenty to offer for a beach getaway.
            <br><br>
            Not popular in the tourist circuit in North India, Chuka Beach has a strong potential to grow as a tourist
            spot. It is actually a water reservoir of Sharda river barrage. It falls under the Mahof forest range,
            between Sharda Sagar Dam and Sharda Canal, in Pilibhit district. The area surrounding Chuka Beach is
            protected by the state government, and has been converted into a picnic spot so as to promote tourism.
            The region enclosing Chuka Beach is marked for the religious shrines and pervading peace and serenity. A 2
            km ride through the dense forest leads to the Chuka Beach. Apparently, this place is famous for its big
            cats, fox, jackals and so on. A canteen, run by the government is where you can get tea and snacks for the
            visitors.
