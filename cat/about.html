        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>
            Welcome to our Website's About page. We developed this website as a part of a project exhibition for our
            BTech programme in 2023. Our website is a unique attempt at helping our users discover the lesser-known
            destinations of India that might offer them the kind of travelling experience that is unconventional and
            highly underrated. <br>We also aim at helping the tourism of the various states of India and of India in
            general by promoting the places that hold potential to become tourism hotspots in near future.
